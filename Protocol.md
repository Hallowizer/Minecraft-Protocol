Minecraft Protocol
==================

Data Formats
------------

Before we begin to discuss the format and use of each packet in the Minecraft Protocol,
we need to set some bounds on what data and field types are available to be sent in each packet.
These types and their uses are outlined in the table below.
The more complex data types such as `varint`, `itemstack` and `metadata` will have their own section detailing parsing and handling below.

Data Type    | Description
------------ | -----------
Byte         | Single byte consiting of 8 bits. This has a range of -127 to 127 signed, or 0 to 255 unsigned.
Byte Array   | An array of bytes. This is serialized as the length field, followed by the bytes.
String       | A byte array where the bytes represent the characters in the String.
String Array | An array of Strings. Similar to byte arrays, this is the length field, followed by the bytes.
UUID         | An id. This is serialized as two longs, the most significant bits coming first.


Packet Format
-------------

Each packet in the Minecraft protocol comes sent in a vary distinct data format.
First, each frame begins with a varint that signifies the entire length of the following data.
This varint contains both the length of the `Packet ID` and the length of the `Packet Data`.

Field Name  | Type
----------- | -------
Length      | varint
Packet ID   | varint
Packet Data | varies

Handshake Packets
-----------------

The Handshake protocol is the initial protocol. Its one packet specifies which protocol to switch to.

**Handshake**<br>
The Handshake packet is the first packet, having id 0x00, which gets sent from the client to the server. Its packet data format is as follows:

Field Name         | Type   | Notes
---------------    | ------ | ------
Protocol Version   | varint | Each version has a number that is not related to the Minecraft version name.
Host               | String | This is how BungeeCord detects a host for forced hosts.
Port               | varint | 
Requested Protocol | varint | Protocol 1 is the Status protocol, and protocol 2 is the Login protocol.

Status Packets
--------------

The Status protocol is the protocol where information like the motd is received. It is used when a client opens the server selection screen.

**Status Request**
The Status Request packet is the packet sent to the server after the Handshake. Its id is 0x00. This packet contains no fields.<br><br>

**Status Response**
The Status Response packet is the packet sent back to the client when the server receives a Status Request. Its id is 0x00.

Field Name   | Type   | Notes
------------ | ------ | ------
Response     | String | This has JSON format, see below.

This packet's field has JSON format. The structure is as follows:<br><br>

Response<br>
--- version - Tag, information about the version that the client shows when it is on the wrong version.<br>
------ name - String, the name of the version.<br>
------ protocol - Integer, the protocol number.<br>
--- players - Tag, information about the online players.<br>
------ online - Integer, the online player count.<br>
------ max - Integer, the maximum player count.<br>
------ sample - Array, a sample list of players.<br>
--------- name - The player's username.<br>
--------- uuid - The UUID of the player. Minecraft will error if it receives an invalid UUID.<br>
--- description - Tag, formatted like a tellraw nbt tag.<br>
--- favicon - String, the icon that shows up on the server. It is a data URL, containing the image's contents encoded in base 64.<br>

**Ping**<br>
The Ping packet is a bidirectional packet that the server echoes back to the client. Its id is 0x01 both directions.

Field Name   | Type   | Notes
------------ | ------ | -------
Time         | Long   | The time that the packet was sent to the server.
